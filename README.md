Description
Mr Assitance is a queue manager app that helps people make the queue much faster and easier especially in a crowded people line. The idea of the app is to sort queues for more smooth transactions and appointments. In the first page you can select your what are your concerns regarding your appointment. After that each button will direct you to a different page where you will interact more about your concerns. Instead of queueing in line or requesting for appointments, you just need to register yourself and select your concerns and the app will generate your queue number that you will give to the counter. Mr Assistance goal is to provide more reliable transactions and appointments that will help the queue to improve end-user waiting times. Also manages the waiting experience of your customers throughout all the touchpoints with your business, from preservice up to after service.
